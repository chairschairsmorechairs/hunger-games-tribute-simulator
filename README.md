# Hunger Games Tribute Simulator
Unfinished version of the hunger games tribute simulator I guess??
I am planning to use python and pyscript in html to view it from a browser. 
Expect this to be completed by november 26th or never.

Note: yes this has definitely been done before, but I wanted to try out something that could be different, maybe something that I could end up doing for a job? 

also trying to prove that ai can't quite take coding yet. not that vibe coding doesn't already exist xD
